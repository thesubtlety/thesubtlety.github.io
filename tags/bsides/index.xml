      <description>I recently attended my first security conference: BSidesDC. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a write up of that experience, although it was quite interesting and I learned a lot via some great sessions. One talk I really enjoyed by @grecs was Malware Analysis 101. Very well presented with lots of great getting started material.
  Anyways, the badges. Pretty cool badges; bottle openers in fact, with fourteen binary bytes all with leading zeroes around the circumference: ascii encoded binary.</description>
