      <description>I came across OpenDNS Security Ninjas AppSec Training Lab not too long ago and found its simplicity rather enjoyable. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple web app written in PHP which illustrates each of the OWASP Top 10 categories. As I was going through the exercises I found myself checking to see how the vulnerable code was written and how the issues could be remediated.
Since the lab is geared towards beginners, I thought it might be helpful to provide brief explanations along with links to the relevant lines of source code.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten how to do this over the past year, here are the directions for posterity.
  Startcom sends you a reminder after 50 weeks and opens a window for a renewal. Log in and validate your email and domain using the Validation Wizard. Note, you need to ensure your email is going to forward properly.
  Generate a key and CSR on the server with the following two commands openssl genrsa -out .</description>

      <description>Here, shall I attempt to document some random doings related to computers, security, linuxstuff, windowsstuff, and most likely miscellany.
Apparently typing all this out helps the mind become better at communicating, and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want that?
So whether you or another read these ramblings, or I myself re-read them later on in my ever so awe-inspiring,Â galvanic, exhilarating life, let this be a place for learning and perusing.</description>
