      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few months working through the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course by Offensive Security which has been an awesome learning experience.
Much has been said on this course and I&amp;rsquo;ll only briefly go over my experience and takeaways. The following reviews were helpful in making the decision to take the course.

There is unfortunately nothing groundbreaking here, and nothing too interesting beyond a demonstration.
