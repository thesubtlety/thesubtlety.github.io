      <description>I am a security professional with over seven years of experience and have held roles troubleshooting large networks and securing web and mobile applications. For the last three years I have been red teaming at several Fortune 500s across multiple industries.
I have a strong track record of applying creative thinking and determination to solve technical challenges. I contribute to open source software including the Metasploit framework1 and enjoy sharing my technical learning experiences through this blog.</description>
