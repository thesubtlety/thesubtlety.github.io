      <description>I read this article by Patrick McKenzie a while back, came across it again, and decided it&amp;rsquo;s worth reading weekly. I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled out some of his bolded points. But seriously, read the article in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety. Again. And again.

      <description>I was fortunate enough to get a good job in IT right out of college. Not in InfoSec, but in telecom, and in specific, service delivery. I&amp;rsquo;m learning an incredible amount - from enterprise telephony environment to working in a highly complex work environment to leading delivery on new intent projects.

In my search for ways to break into InfoSec, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across numerous posts, advice, and tips to do just that.</description>
