      <description>I came across OpenDNS Security Ninjas AppSec Training Lab not too long ago and found its simplicity rather enjoyable. It&#39;s a simple web app written in PHP which illustrates each of the OWASP Top 10 categories. As I was going through the exercises I found myself checking to see how the vulnerable code was written and how the issues could be remediated.
Since the lab is geared towards beginners, I thought it might be helpful to provide brief explanations along with links to the relevant lines of source code.</description>
